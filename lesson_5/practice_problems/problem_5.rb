# Practice Problem 5

# Given this nested Hash:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

# figure out the total age of just the male members of the family.
total_age = 0
munsters.map do |array|
  array.select do |values|
  total_age += values["age"] if values["gender"] == "male"
  end
end
p total_age
